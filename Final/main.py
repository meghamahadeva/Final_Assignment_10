Description: This program focuses on calculating the earnings and loss of each share for Bob Smith. It will also show which share has made the most earning
             and which share has suffered the biggest loss till June 3rd 2022.Predefined purchase price and purchase date has been considered from Data_Stock.csv
             and using Yahoo Finance API to consider the latest selling price and date(June 3rd) for calculations. The try and error functions has been used to
             test a block of code for errors and the except to handle the error. This program will visualize the stock value as per the purchase dates.
